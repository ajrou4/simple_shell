#Project Description
This project is an implementation of a basic shell, similar to the Unix shell. The shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by entering commands. The shell reads user input, interprets the command, and executes it.

This implementation of the shell is written in C and supports basic shell functionality such as executing commands, changing directories, and environment variables. It also supports background processes, input/output redirection, and pipeline commands.

#Installation
To install and run the shell, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ajrou4/shell-implementation.git
Navigate to the project directory using the following command:
bash
Copy code
cd shell-implementation
Compile the program using the following command:
go
Copy code
make
Run the shell using the following command:
bash
Copy code
./shell
#Usage
Once you have started the shell, you can enter commands in the following format:

bash
Copy code
command [arguments]
You can also use the following special commands:

cd [directory]: change the current working directory to the specified directory
exit: exit the shell
You can also use the following features:

&: run a command in the background
>: redirect output to a file
<: redirect input from a file
|: pipe the output of one command as input to another command
